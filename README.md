# MacBookProMockup
This is the result of a project done at University for an exam (Universit√† degli Studi di Perugia).  

Task consisted to build some 3D object out of a software and to use WebGL libraries to render it on a webpage.  
For the task I decided to build a 3D concept of the Macbook Pro with Touchbar, which was so rumored back at the time.  
The object was designed using Autodesk Maja while all the used graphics were done in Photoshop (In lack of Illustrator Skills)
